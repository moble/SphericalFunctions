SphericalFunctions
==================

C++ library for computing Wigner D matrices, spin-weighted spherical
harmonics, and associated quantities needed for functions on the
sphere.  Python bindings are supplied via SWIG.


Getting started
===============

To get this code, run

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/MOBle/SphericalFunctions.git

The `recursive` flag must be passed because this project uses
[`Quaternions`](https://github.com/MOBle/Quaternions) as a submodule,
which also needs to be downloaded.
